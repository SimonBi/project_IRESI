=================================== Project ====================================
Course: IRESI
Authors: Simon Bihel, Florestan De Moor
Institute: ENS Rennes, Computer Science Department


================================= Requirements =================================

We used python3 along with the libraries matplotlib and numpy for this project.
You might need to run
    $ pip3 install numpy matplotlib

On Ubuntu, the option "interp='linear'" for griddata might not work, removing it
may make it work.


================================== Run tests ===================================

Both test will plot the real codeviance matrix (green chart), the average
codeviance matrix calculated over nb_tests runs of the SketchMin algorithm
(red chart) (nb_tests is currently set to 10, it can be modified), and the
standard deviation of the SketchMin results (blue chart).


    - Real traces
Simply type :
    $ python3 tests.py

    - Randomly generated traces
Simply type :
    $ python3 tests_simulated_entries.py
